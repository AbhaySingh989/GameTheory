## 🌟 Introduction: More Than Just a Game

Have you ever wondered how cooperation evolves in a world of selfish individuals? The **Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic problem in game theory that explores this very question. This simulator isn't just a piece of software; it's a digital laboratory for students, educators, and enthusiasts to experiment with and visualize the complex dynamics of trust, betrayal, and strategy.

This project showcases the ability to create sophisticated, data-driven simulations that are not only functional but also serve as powerful educational tools. It demonstrates a deep understanding of complex algorithms, user interface design, and data visualization, transforming an abstract concept into an engaging and interactive experience.

## 🎯 What is the Prisoner's Dilemma?

Imagine two partners in crime, arrested and held in separate cells. They can either **Cooperate** with their partner (stay silent) or **Defect** (testify against them).

*   If both cooperate, they both get a small sentence.
*   If one defects and the other cooperates, the defector goes free, and the cooperator gets a harsh sentence.
*   If both defect, they both get a medium sentence.

The "dilemma" is that while it's always rational for an individual to defect, the best outcome for the group is for both to cooperate. This simulator explores what happens when this game is played over and over again.

## 🔎 A Look Inside the Simulator

### Single Game Mode
Pit any two strategies against each other in a head-to-head match. The real-time visualization shows you the move history and score, allowing you to see exactly how a strategy behaves.

### Tournament Mode
Find out which strategy reigns supreme! Run a full tournament with multiple participants. Choose from three different formats:
*   **Round Robin:** Every strategy plays against every other strategy.
*   **Elimination:** A single-loss elimination bracket.
*   **Group Stage + Knockout:** A format similar to the World Cup, with a group stage followed by a knockout round.

### Sandbox Mode
Get your hands dirty with the Sandbox mode. You can play manually against an AI, or watch two AIs play one round at a time. This mode is perfect for in-depth analysis and understanding the turn-by-turn logic of each strategy.

### Custom Strategy Builder
Become a game theorist! The custom strategy builder allows you to create your own strategies from scratch using a simple, rule-based system. You can define rules based on the opponent's last move, their cooperation rate, or the current round number.

### Advanced Analytics & Logging
Data is beautiful. The simulator includes a powerful analytics tab that visualizes key statistics like total score, win rate, and average score per game. All match and tournament results are also automatically logged to an Excel file, so you can perform your own analysis.

## 🎓 A Powerful Educational Tool

This simulator is designed to be a compelling educational resource:

*   **Brings Theory to Life:** It transforms abstract game theory concepts into a tangible, interactive experience.
*   **Encourages Critical Thinking:** Students can formulate hypotheses about which strategies will succeed and test them in a controlled environment.
*   **Demonstrates Emergent Behavior:** Witness how simple rules can lead to complex, system-wide patterns of cooperation or conflict.
*   **Perfect for the Classroom:** Educators can use it to create engaging lessons and assignments on topics like game theory, evolution, AI, and ethics.

## 🚀 How to Use
